    nar "It was a normal night..."
    nar "I was sitting in my office as usual, silently working away on some left over paper work..."
    nar "Leaning back in my chair, I closed my eyes for a moment thinking back on todays events."
    nar "It's been a weird one for sure... Not just appearing in this office but also the whole situation in general..."
    nar "Not having had the time to reflect on things yet and just trying to settle in the best I could I suddenly found this moment to reflect."
    nar "My eyes again, focused on the paper work..."
    nar "Well, I guess it could be worse... Weather is... acceptable."
    nar "I sat back up and hunched myself over the parchment."
    nar "Why do I have to do this stuff again... Surely there should be some kind of secretary helping..."
    nar "Suddenly the door opened as if my wishes had come true... Something about this felt backwards for some reason."

    her "Mr.D."
    nar "Said the figure at the door, only just outside the light..."
    m "\"Mr... what?\""
    nar "I thought..."
    nar "Now trying my best to focus on the figure in front of me."
    her "Mr.D?"
    nar "After hearing the urgent tone in the voice, I responded... seemingly out of reflex..."
    m "Yes?"
    nar "The figure shifted their posture in a relieved fashion as if they had been trying to get a hold of me for hours and said..."
    her "Mr.D... I've been trying to contact you for hours. But it looks like your your phone may be off..."
    m "My phone?"
    nar "I said in a puzzled manner..."
    nar "I never had a phone in here... in fact, there's not a single electronic in this office..."
    nar "After a few moments the figure stepped into the light, illuminating a girls face." 
    her "..."
    nar "Her hazel coloured flowing hair reminded me of a leather bound book, filled to the brim with the secrets of the girl in front of me..."
    nar "Suddenly I felt myself becoming lost in her brown mysterious eyes, which provoked a sense of great pain and suffering."
    her "I'm so glad I found you... I've been trying to locate you for ages, you're not an easy man to find..."
    nar "Lost in thought, my mouth seemed to move on its own as I replied to the girl..."
    m "Of course..."
    nar "Taken aback from my own automatic response I thought to myself... "
    g4 "\"What am I doing, this girl seems to think I'm someone called... Mr.D?\""
    nar "Surely that can't be me... unless this is some other secret alias of mine... It appears she may know me though, I better press further..."
    her "I knew you were good but I didn't think you'd manage to do it so discretely as you did...."
    her "How professional..."
    her "And such a looker too... I can't believe we hadn't met until now..."
    nar "The only thing I could gather so far is that I must've helped her with some sort of delicate matter..."
    nar "I looked down at my papers again, trying to find some kind of clue what this might be..."
    nar "Tax fraud?"
    her "..."
    nar "The girl stood there for a minute, looking as if she wanted to say something but being unsure how to go about doing so..."
    nar "My eyes met with hers again, as I looked back up from my desk."
    her "..."
    nar "She blushed, now with slightly guilty expression, fidgeting and clearly out of her comfort zone..."
    nar "As I was about to open my mouth and speak, a voice that coming from no specific direction chimed in before I even got a word out..."
    her "Silencio."
    #[Flash of light] [Hermione is now behind the desk]
    nar "After a few seconds I went to ask where that voice and bright light had come from but as I tried to, I could only feel my lips moving with no sound emerging..."
    nar "Taken aback by this, I pushed myself back in my chair and stood up clutching my vocal cords..."
    nar "I turned around, now feeling slightly worried, looking for the source of the voice."
    her "Don't say anything else... you know why I'm here, we had a deal remember..."
    nar "The girl had now moved to behind the desk..."
    nar "was this it... did I break a deal of ours?"
    nar "Was this girl here to kill me, is that why she sounded so worried..."
    nar "Now feeling rather dizzy I steadied myself on my desk, trying to compose myself..."
    nar "Suddenly I felt a sharp tug and I knew this must be it..."
    g4 "..."
    nar "Waiting a few moment for the pain to emerge..."
    g4 "..."
    nar "But the pain never came..."
    her "I hope this should suffice... I couldn't stand the thought of discussing this any further..."
    her "I'm supposed to be a reputable girl after all..."
    nar "After gaining focus I looked down and found the girl kneeling in front of me, now grabbing a hold of my shaft."
    nar "Even if I were able to respond I had but a second notice before her lips had wrapped themselves around my cock."
    call her_main("*Slurp!* *Gulp!* *Slurp!*",ypos="head")
    nar "Her head, now bobbing back and forwards as if her life depended on it..."
    nar "I felt myself going harder in her mouth as her lips pressed against my skin..."
    her "*Slurp!* *Gobble!*"
    nar "What had this girl made me do for her to make her degrade herself in such a manner..."
    nar "The girl then glanced up into my eyes seeing my confused look..."
    nar "Interpreting this expression as her efforts being unsatisfactory, she then concentrated on the task she had set for herself and pushed her head forwards, taking the whole length down her throat."
    call her_main("*Gulp!* *Gobble!* *Gobble!*")
    nar "Since couldn't make a sound I let out a heavy breath of air and closed my eyes for a few seconds..."
    nar "After a few moments I opened my eyes and turned my head down again to observe scene playing out in front of me."
    nar "Being unable to make any sort of comment the girl suddenly pulled her mouth away..."
    call her_main ("*G-g-gah...*")
    nar "A string of saliva still attached between her mouth and my penis slowly found itself moving down and then disconnected, resting across the back of her arm."
    nar "Now smiling, the girl started massaging my cock with a mixture of precum and her saliva..."
    nar "Feeling more relaxed about the whole situation I couldn't help but forgetting about any consequences and began to just enjoy myself."
    nar "Without warning her lips then wrapped themselves around my now throbbing cock..."
    call her_main("*Slurp!* *Gulp!* *Slurp!*")
    nar "Her head, yet again found itself further and further down my shaft... And now with seemingly more ease her tongue moved slowly across the bottom."
    her "*Slurp!* *Slurp!* *Slurp!*"
    nar "For a moment I could only feel her forehead pushed towards my torso as my cock reached the bottom of her throat and it seemed as if time had stopped..."
    her "..."
    nar "Suddenly she looked up into my eyes as she started moving her tongue, massaging the underside of my cock and balls..."
    her "*Gobble!* *Gltch!* *Slurp!*"
    nar "My eyes closed and without warning I felt a sudden rush of ecstasy come over me, after only being able to let out a inaudible groan my pelvic muscles tightened as I ejaculated down her throat."
    nar "I opened my as hers locked with mine from the sudden overwhelming amount of semen hitting the back of the throat."
    her "*Gulp!-Gulp!-Gulp!*"
    nar "Her eyes watering she looked as if she was about to pass out but kept her head wrapped around my shaft as she tried to swallow it all, a couple of bubbles now forming around her nose." 
    her "*Gulp!-Gulp!-Aahh!*"
    nar "She then pulled away satisfied with her deed, moving back just as another wave of seemingly endless amount of semen found its way spurting out and coating her surprised face..."
    nar "As the residue started flowing down her cheeks, she wiped some off with her finger and let it slide across the fingertip into her open mouth..."
    her "Looks like I've made a mess again..."
    her "I guess that's what I get for using the silencing charm."
    nar "Still being unable to say anything I just stood there, my chest moving up and down as my breathing slowed down."
    nar "The girl, adjusting herself and still slightly covered in semen made her way to the door, only turning around once more..."
    her "I hope that was satisfactory..."
    her "Make it known that Hermione never backs down on a deal..."
    #[Hermione leaves through door]
    nar "My breathing now returning to normal I felt as if someone had been pinching my vocal cords had just released their grasp."
    nar "After clearing my throat and composing myself. I sat back down in my chair trying to get my head around on what had just transpired."
    nar "Hermione she said..."
    nar "It was the only clue you had gotten on who this mysterious girl was, you still had yet to know what kind of favour you had granted her..."
    nar "But it didn't matter, the favour you had received in return was more than enough to make up for anything you might have assisted her with..."
    nar "Or at least that's what you hoped..."
