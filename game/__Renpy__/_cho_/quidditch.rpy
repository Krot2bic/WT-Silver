    #genie suggest for her to play dirty
    ">With a loud bang, your door is flung open as a disgruntled girl marches in."
    cho "It's not fair!"
    cho "Malfoy's pompous old man just bought the whole \'Slytherin\'' team brand new Nimbus 2018s!"
    cho "\'Ravenclaw\'' can't be expected to win against that!"
    cho "I demand you level the playing field sir!"
    m "Why? Is that crooked as well?"
    cho "This isn't funny sir! With \'Slytherin\' playing dirty there's no way we can win!"
    cho "Ugh! I knew you wouldn't do anything..."
    m "So you don't want to hear my solution then?"
    cho "Wait... You are going to help?!"
    cho "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
    cho "I take a small size broom and I'd like gold trim with a dark-"
    m "I'm not buying you a broom..."
    m "(Is quidditch like curling then?)"
    cho "Oh..."
    cho "Then what's your solution?"
    m "You said that the \'Slytherin\'s were playing dirty..."
    m "How about you fight fire with fire then?"
    cho "So you think we should fight dirty too?"
    cho "But how? The rules forbid almost all foul play."
    m "Hmmmm..."
    m "What do they say about uniform?"
    cho "Ugh... I don't think there's anything about the uniform in the rule book sir."
    m "So if you intended to wear a skirt while you played-"
    cho "I couldn't do that!"
    cho "Everyone would be able to see straight up it!"
    cho "Not to mention all the other player-"
    cho "Oh..."
    cho "So that's your plan then? For me to distract \'Slytherin\' with some upskirt?"
    m "If you don't think it would work-"
    cho "Of course it would work! Those \'Slytherin\'s are all a bunch of perverts..."
    cho "But I can't go and play a game with a skirt on!"
    cho "All my friends would see!"
    m "They'll forget all about it after you defeat \'Slytherin\'!"
    cho "I really don't think they will..."
    m "Then just tell them it was the only way to win. I'm sure they'll understand."
    cho "You... might be right..."
    cho "But still... I can't do that... can I?"
    m "Miss Granger would..."
    cho "{size=-5}She would?{/size}"
    cho "Alright! I'll do it!"
    cho "Go Go \'Raveclaw\'!"
    m "So when's your next game?"
    cho "I'm actually about to head over for a practice game against \'hufflepuff\' now..."
    m "Sounds like the perfect time to test out your new uniform..."
    cho "Already!"
    cho "Can't we wait a bit longer sir..."
    m "Hmmm... if you don't feel up for it, Miss Granger could prob-"
    cho "Fine..."
    m "Fantastic! Just come back here after the game to tell me how it went!"
    cho "What? Can't I just run back to my dorm?"
    m "Not unless you want the rules to change again..."
    cho "Ugh... Whatever old man..."
    ">With that Cho turns to leave your office."
    m "..."
    m "(I still have no idea what quidditch is...)"
